#	This code can be implemented using the xampp application. This application is named PayRoll it allows users to manage and update their company’s payroll database. PayRoll can run on the local host of the user’s computer. Once application is running just add database SQL data to phpMyAdmin.

Step 1: Download xampp /ensure local server /sql is running
Step 2: go to the htdocs file in your xampp application.
Step 3: Copy and paste all files other than the read me and SQL code
Step 4: Delete or move other any other files that already exist named index.html
Step 5: go to localhost/phpMyAdmin and add SQL code/create database named PayRoll
Step 6: go to localhost should show log in page. Make sure to type in port number if needed. On my computer I use localhost:8080
